## Collaborative Work

(remove unnecessary parts when done)
In the previous exercise you used the R function called `ggsave()`. 
Your task is to copy over the relevant parts from the R help file regarding the `ggsave()` function.
In particular, this section should be populated (only) with 

1. Description
2. Usage
3. Details
4. Examples

In addition, answer the following question:

> What is the purpose of the arguments `width` and `height` in the `ggsave()` function?

This section of the Markdown file should be formatted nicely so that code is formatted as code, headings as headings, etc. Use the Markdown Cheat Sheet to help you out.

Decide among yourselves how you would like to distribute the tasks! Remember, everyone should contribute equally. Commits and line additions/deletions will be shown on the repo for your instructor to check.
